# VoxLens üéôÔ∏è Voice to Text Summarizer

VoxLens is a voice transcription and summarization tool that converts spoken audio into text and provides concise summaries. Perfect for meetings, lectures, or any scenario where you need quick summaries of voice recordings.

## About This Project

VoxLens was developed as a final project for the Deep Learning course in the 6th semester at CETYS Universidad for Expo Ingenier√≠a. Our team wanted to create a practical application of speech recognition and natural language processing that could be useful in everyday scenarios.

We spent countless late nights training models, debugging API calls, and tweaking the UI - fueled by coffee and the occasional pizza. But honestly, seeing it all come together was worth every debugging session!

## Features

- **Voice Transcription**: Accurate speech-to-text conversion
- **Automatic Summarization**: Get concise summaries of your recordings
- **Real-time Processing**: Quick results without long waits
- **Simple Interface**: Just hit record and let VoxLens do the rest
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Easy on the eyes, day or night
- **Multi-language Support**: Currently supports English and Spanish UI

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **ML Models**: Whisper for transcription, BART for summarization
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization
